## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a very interesting learning process for me. Prior to today, i had no knowledge about adding a font family to a html document with Google fonts but during the creation of this i was fortunate to come across it.

I also learnt how adding a margin property to the body element could have some really frustrating effects on your webpage. I got to play around and understand better several properties on CSS Flexbox ( justify-content, flex-basis, flex-direction) and i had my first official experience using media queries for responsive web design.

Overall, it was a breathtaking process and i mean that literally...lol... but the joy in me when i realized i had successfully completed it knew no bounds.

### Continued development

I'd put in more efforts to make sure i'm able to grasp the whole concept surronding HTML and CSS and then i would take the bold step futher and begin learning Javascript.
